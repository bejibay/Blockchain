# Buildblockchains
* The Buildblochains contains lines of codes(in JavaScript and nodejs) for
building blockchains which are used in cyptocurrencies, smart contracts
and decentralised applications(DAPPS).
* It contains proof of work and proof of validity.
* In the future, the codes will be extended with:
use of transactions,peer to peer communications 
and use of wallets(user interface for cyptocurrecies)    
## Applications
* The codes are basis for building blockchains applications. They
can be enhanced and extended.                                                
### Note 
*A blockchan can be created with any other language
 such as Python, PHP, Java, Solidity, C++ etc
